    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "- Using NLTK's Inaugural Address (inaugural) corpus, create three keyword-based document retrieval systems. The corpus consists of inaugural addresses made by U.S presidents upon assuming office.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "- The system should take keywords from user and return the most relevant inaugural speeches (a maximum of 5) based on the keywords.\n",
    "- The matches need not be verbatim.\n",
    "- The system should return results with the matching regions highlighted.\n",
    "- Build three IR systems based on TF-IDF Vectorization, Binary Independence Model and a custom model created by you.\n",
    "- Run the following keywords on all three systems and report the results. Compare the results and write your observations. You can also use your own keyword combinations in addition to the ones mentioned below:\n",
    "  - freedom, jobs\n",
    "  - slavery, war\n",
